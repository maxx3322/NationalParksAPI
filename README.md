Hello and welcome to the Natiional Parks API.  This is an API that I have developed  
to display various national parks from around the USA. This is an ongoing project that
I continue to add features too overtime. 

                          
                          How I built it
                                                                  
    Using Microsoft Visual studio, I utilized the MVC pattern to build this API.  
    I focused on following the REST API pattern and using SOLID principles. 
    For the database I used 
    SQL server, and the SQL server magagement tools.  Along with this I used 
    POSTMAN to verify the API was handeling routes appropriately.
